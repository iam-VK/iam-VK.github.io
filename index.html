				<div class="about_content">
					<p class="about_para">
						Back in 2012, I decided to try my hand at creating custom Tumblr
						themes and tumbled head first into the rabbit hole of coding and web
						development. Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of
						building software for an advertising agency, a start-up, a
						student-led design studio, and a huge corporation. <br /><br />
						My main focus these days is building products and leading projects
						for our clients at Upstatement. In my free time I've also released
						an online video course that covers everything you need to know to
						build a web app with the Spotify API. <br />
						<br />
						When I’m not at the computer, I’m usually rock climbing, hanging out
						with my wife and two cats, or running around Hyrule searching for
						Korok seeds korokseeds.
